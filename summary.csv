0,04/12/2022,national,https://www.dawn.com/news/1724594/qaiser-rues-decision-to-grant-extension-to-bajwa,Qaiser rues decision to grant extension to Bajwa - ,"ISLAMABAD: A week after retired Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa completed his extended tenure, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Asad Qaiser has said the decision to grant a three-year extension to the former army chief was a “wrong decision”, which the party regretted.
Gen Bajwa was given an extension by former prime minister Imran Khan in 2019 three months before the completion of his three-year term as the chief of army staff. Mr Qaiser, however, added that the decision to extend his tenure was a “collective” decision of parliament and all political parties supported the move. 
“Everyone [in the party ranks] is realising that it was a mistake to grant him [Bajwa] an extension,” the former National Assembly speaker said, adding that such decisions should not be made for the sake of individuals.
The remarks by the former National Assembly spea­­ker came during an interview with DawnNewsTV’s Nadir Gurmani on Saturday. 
When asked if there was any “pressure” on the government to extend the tenure of ex-COAS, the PTI leader refused to answer the question and said that no matter why or how the decision was taken, the move to grant the extension to the former army chief was wrong nonetheless.
‘Open to talks’
The PTI leader said the former ruling party was willing to sit with the government to find a solution to the prevailing political impasse provided that the government added general elections to the agenda for the dialogue. “We are ready to talk to the government…we are not asking them to give us the date for the [general] elections beforehand,” he said, adding that it was, however, their demand that elections should be a part of the agenda for the dialogue with the government.
He elaborated that the PTI was not looking for statements from ministers regarding the elections, but a “proper policy statement” that should say negotiation on elections would be part of the agenda.

1,04/12/2022,national,https://www.dawn.com/news/1724593/imran-couldve-opted-for-suicide-attack-if-treated-like-swati,Imran could’ve ‘opted for suicide attack if treated like Swati’ - ,"QUETTA / PESHAWAR: As Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Senator Azam Swati was booked in another case on Friday for posting controversial tweets, party chief Imran Khan defended the former’s outbursts against the army, saying anybody who faced the kind of torture the lawmaker was meted out would have used such language in anger. 
Reacting to the objectionable video featuring Mr Swati, Imran Khan said he would have gone to any extent in revenge. 
Chairing a meeting of PTI’s parliamentary party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in Peshawar via video link from Lahore, the former prime minister said that criticism was permitted in democracies across the world but the 75-year-old [Swati] was tortured naked on the directions of ‘Dirty Harry’. 

Another case registered against PTI senator at Qilla Abdullah

“Who will not react [to it]. I would have gone to any extant to take revenge — would have [even] considered carrying out a suicide attack had someone done this to me,” Mr Khan said.  
He asked the PTI legislators to hold a protest demonstration against Mr Swati’s arrest. 
The fresh FIR against Azam Swati was registered at the Qilla Abdullah police station on the complaint of a citizen against the abusive language used by the PTI senator in his tweets as well as speech he delivered at a rally in Rawalpindi last month. 
Mr Swati, who was brought to Quetta from Islamabad on Friday, is scheduled to be produced before a magistrate on Sunday (today) in one of such cases registered at Quetta and Kuchlak police stations.

2,04/12/2022,national,https://www.dawn.com/news/1724592/three-police-officials-martyred-in-nowshera-gun-attack,Three police officials martyred in Nowshera gun attack - ,"PESHAWAR: Three policemen were martyred in an attack in the Akora Khattak area of Nowshera district on Saturday, police and rescue sources have said.
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement, the militant outfit said its fighters had ambushed the police van.
A police spokesperson told Dawn attackers opened fire at a police van near Sariya Khel police checkpoint.
According to Rescue 1122, the martyred cops were identified as Manzoor, who was Akora Khattak police station moharir; constable Amanullah and mobile driver Ayaz.
KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan condemned the incident and sought a report from KP police chief.
The attack came a few days after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government and asked its combatants to carry out attacks across the country.
This was also the second attack on police in less than a month in KP. On Nov 16, six cops were martyred when their van came under gunfire in Lakki Marwat.
‘Militant’ killed
Separately, an alleged militant commander was killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in the Shewa area of North Waziristan, the military’s media wing has said.
The ISPR identified the dece­ased as Muhammad Noor alias Sarakai, who was a ‘notorious militant commander’ involved in attacks on security forces and kidnapping for ransom. He was also wanted by the police’s Counter Terrorism Department.
Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from his possession, the ISPR added.

3,04/12/2022,national,https://www.dawn.com/news/1724591/5-coal-miners-killed-in-gas-explosion-in-harnai,5 coal miners killed in gas explosion in Harnai - Pakistan ,"QUETTA: At least five coal miners were killed in a gas explosion in a coal mine in the Shahrag coal field area of Harnai district on Saturday, while another labourer remained untraceable during the daylong rescue operation.
The labourers were identified as Naseeb Gul, Sarfraz, Najeebullah, Rehman Ullah, Ghani Rehman and Bacha Khan. All of them belong to the Shangla area of Swat.
The incident came as a grim reminder of the Orakzai mine blast, that claimed the lives of nine labourers a few days ago.
Official sources said six labourers were working in a coal mine in the Shahrag area when a powerful blast took place and a portion of the mine collapsed, leaving all the miners trapped.
Other miners in the vicinity and rescue teams rushed to the site and launched an operation to rescue them and retrieve the bodies. 
Speaking to Dawn, Chief Inspector of Mines Ghani Baloch explained that a fire erupted after the gas explosion some 1,500 feet deep inside the mine, blocked its mouth. He said rescue teams managed to recover five bodies of the coal miners. 
“One body is still buried under the debris,” he said, adding that the incident took place at 9am when the miners were digging out coal.
He said rescue teams were making all-out efforts to find out the sixth miner. But “the presence of methane gas inside the mine is creating hurdle in rescue operations,” he added, expressing the apprehension that the man trapped inside the mine might not have survived.
The authorities have ordered an investigation into the incident.

“The future development and wellbeing of every country is highly dependent on good educationists, being a vivid source of learning, achievements and enlightenment for the benefit of their students,” observed Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar but regretted that the discriminatory treatment with teachers was totally ill-founded, prejudicial and inequitable.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, a three-judge Supreme Court bench had taken up a joint appeal moved by KP chief secretary and provincial secretary of elementary and secondary education and higher education, archives and libraries department.
The appeals were instituted against different judgments of the Peshawar High Court of Nov 2019, Feb 2020 and March 2021, which upheld the plea moved before it by 76 certified teachers in KP’s elementary and secondary education department in Grade 15.
The KP government discontinued conveyance allowance during summer and winter vacations, which previously was admissible to teachers. They approached KP service tribunal, which allowed their plea, but the KP government took the stance that tribunal’s order suffers from illegality, factually incorrect and in violation of a notification issued for the discontinuation of conveyance allowance during vacations.
While dismissing the appeal of KP officials, the SC observed non-payment or deduction of conveyance allowance would amount to violation of fundamental rights.

In a statement issued on Saturday, Quetta’s central police office said it had reliably learnt that Daesh — the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State (IS) militant group — was planning to carry out a suicide attack in Quetta.
In this regard, a female suicide bomber named Zeenat, wife of Ziaur Rehman, daughter of Yar Muhammad Shahwani and resident of Khadkocha, had already volunteered herself for the suicide attack, the police said.
The statement said that it was further learnt that she was currently living with “Daesh terrorist” Ghulam Din at an undisclosed location in Mastung district.
She had remained reportedly present with militants in their hideout at Pari Jhal and Nagao areas in the Bolan range, the statement said.
The central police office has asked all authorities concerned to take necessary action and preventive measures through concerned SSP and SPs in their respective areas to avoid any untoward incident.
“All entry and exit points of Quetta will be checked and more security personnel will be deployed,” Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove said.

Insolvency and Companies Court (ICC) Judge Clive Jones had granted a five-day hearing for the case last week, but the prosecution was unable to cross-examine all witnesses from the defendant side within this time. The testimonies of MQM Supremo Altaf Hussain and MQM-London member Sufyan Yousuf are yet to be heard by the court, and are expected to take place in the new year.
Speaking to Dawn, MQM-London member Mustafa Azizabadi said he explained to the court that the BT call recording system kept at the international secretariat was destroyed.
Mr Azizabadi said when the properties case was initiated in 2019, solicitors informed members of MQM-London that evidence must be submitted, including the BT call recording system.
He told the court that system had been discarded by the MQM, as it was deemed old and no longer useable.
“Police in the UK seized some computers and equipment from MQM’s London office on two occassions, in 2012 and 2019. Those items, about 18 or so computers, were returned to us in April 2022.”
He added, “When we examined the returned items, we realised after opening two or three that the systems were too outdated to be used. The BT recorder was among these items, and so we discarded all of them.”

The move, aimed at structural reforms in the social welfare schemes, was approved by the BISP board meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Atta Marri.
In a video message, she said this was the first time in Pakistan’s history that trans people were being provided the opportunity to become beneficiaries of the Benazir Kafalat Programme (BKP). They would have to register with the BISP to benefit from it, she said.
The BISP tweeted: “56th Board Meeting of Benazir Income Support Program, which held under chair of Federal Minister and BISP Chairperson Shazia Atta Marri, has taken decisions of structural reforms, extending benefits to transgender community and aimed to extend all possible help to needy people.”
The minister termed the approval of the transgender policy a “landmark achievement” of the present government and urged the board members to use their “good offices and influence” to mobilise the marginalised community so that the maximum number of transgender persons could benefit from the policy, Dawn.com reported.
She also outlined the process for the members of the transgender community to register themselves with BKP, adding that they would receive Rs7,000 upon successful registration.
For registration, only persons registered with Nadra and whose computerised national identity cards mention they are transgender are eligible to apply. 
They can visit BISP office in their relevant tehsil and ask for the survey form at the registration counter. Upon successful registration, they can obtain information on the grant by sending an SMS to 8171.
